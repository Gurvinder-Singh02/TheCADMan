### Standards

International standards are a set of guidelines or specifications that are agreed upon by a group of experts or organizations to ensure the quality, safety, compatibility, and interoperability of products, services, processes, or systems.

International standards can facilitate trade, communication, collaboration, and innovation across different countries and regions. International standards related to CAD design are those that define the best practices for creating, managing, exchanging, and using CAD data and documents.

Organizations that develop and publish standards are:
