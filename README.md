# TheCADMan

Welcome to TheCADMan, a comprehensive public repository for CAD users. This repository is designed to equip students, enthusiasts, and professionals with the essential tools, tips, and techniques to become excellent CAD users. Whether you are new to CAD or a seasoned pro, this repository has something for everyone.

The main objective of TheCADMan is to be a comprehensive learning hub for Computational Aided Design (CAD), covering industrial design theory, manufacturing design process, and international standards such as DIN and ISO. Another purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized FAQ platform for students, professionals, and enthusiasts to learn and share knowledge about CAD.

**What You Will Find Here**

In this repository, you will find:

* A collection of CAD files of various industrial parts and assemblies that you can download, view, modify, and use for your own projects.
* A series of tutorials and guides on how to use different CAD software and tools.
* A comprehensive overview of the principles and concepts of industrial design theory, such as form, function, ergonomics, aesthetics, materials, etc.
* A detailed explanation of the steps and methods involved in the manufacturing design process, such as ideation, prototyping, testing, validation, etc.
* A summary of the main international standards and regulations that apply to CAD engineering, such as DIN (German Institute for Standardization), Ermeto Original DIN fittings, and ISO (International Organization for Standardization).
